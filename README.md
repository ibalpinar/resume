# Resume - Ilker Balpinar

This is a resume that I prepared for myself. To be honest, I saw a one-page resume of Elon Musk years ago, and I was completely inspired by him.

You can take the skeleton of this resume and prepare your own or see it in action at [balpinar.com](https://balpinar.com).

By the way, I decided that this resume outline can be modified by everyone for themselves. In this way, people will be able to create their resumes without paying. When I finish my work in this repository, I will start the ResumeX project and create a completely free and open-source platform where everyone can create their own resume.

In this way, you will be able to contribute to the project and also have a resume that is always up to date and accessible online.
