# resume

This is a resume that I prepared for myself. To be honest, I saw a one-page resume of Elon Musk years ago, and I was completely inspired by him.

You can take the skeleton of this resume and prepare your own.

By the way, I decided that this resume outline can be modified by everyone for themselves. In this way, people will be able to create their resumes without paying.

New visual designs will be added step by step to this draft.
